# Prerequisites for the DevOps course

For the DevOps course, it is required:

1. Familiarity with [command-line interface (CLI)
2. Understanding Web and database technologies
3. Basic programming skills in any language

## 1. Familiarity with command-line interface (CLI)

[Link to Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

- Windows   
  use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or PowerShell instead of default CMD. You will have the same syntax and commands as in the Linux environment. It is recommended because the most of software is running on Linux servers.
- Linux/macOS   
  Use default Terminal. You can customize it with lots of open-source utilities, follow this [link](https://medium.com/@smile2gether/how-to-customize-your-mac-os-terminal-880c4097b18b).

## 2. Understanding Web and database technologies

- SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## 3. Basic programming skills

Javascript (Node.js) is chosen to build a basic web application. In the classes, we will create a simple http-server exposing [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). The source code will be covered by unit (functional, integration, etc.) tests.

Instead of using Node.js, you can use another programming language (Python, PHP, C++, Java, Ruby...) up to your choice. In this case, the functionality of the application must be similar to the provided one by the teacher, and it requires:

- http-server exposing a home page
- REST API (ex: create user, get user, delete user)
- a storage (ex: file system or any database)
- full tests coverage using any test framework (ex: JUnit for Java, Mocha for Node.js, etc.)
- using any package manager (ex: Maven for Java, NPM for Node.js, etc.)

### Learning Node.js

You can google tons of materials and tutorials (video and text) for learning Node.js. Many of them are starting from creating a basic http-server using [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/) or the internal Node.js [http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http).
